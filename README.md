# Acklen Avenue QA Challenge 

This repository reflects the work that I did based on the test website https://www.shino.de/parkcalc/. 

The tests is divides in two sections, expected scenarios and bugs. For the expected scenarios I based myself on the rates available for each parking option available and made sure that all the inputs matched the expected result. Also, there are a couple of tests that validate bugs that I was able to find in the website. 



## Usage

```bash

$ git clone https://github.com/Fractures95/Acklen-Challenge.git

$ cd Acklen-Challenge

$ npm i

$ npm t (to start automated test) 

```
